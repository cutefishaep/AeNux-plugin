- For `.exe` installers, **manual steps may be required** after installation (see Zenity instructions).
- **No files are deleted** unless you confirm via Zenity.

## 💬 Troubleshooting

  Install with: `sudo apt install wine`
- **Zenity not installed?**  
  The script will auto-install it, or run: `sudo apt install zenity`
- **Permission denied?**  
  Run: `chmod +x plugin.sh`
